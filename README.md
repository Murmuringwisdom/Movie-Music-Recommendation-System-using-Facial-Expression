# Movie-Music-Recommendation-System-using-Facial-Expression

This project captures a user's facial expression in real-time using a webcam and uses emotion recognition to determine their current mood. Based on the detected emotion (e.g., happy, sad, angry, surprised), the system recommends personalized Hollywood or Bollywood songs and movies that match the user's emotional state. It's a smart and interactive way to enhance your entertainment experience using computer vision and mood-based curation.
